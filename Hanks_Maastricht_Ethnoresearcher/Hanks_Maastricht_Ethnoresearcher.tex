\opening{Dear Search Committee,} 
With this letter I hereby wish to apply for the \textbf{history of medicine and technology postdoctoral research} position at Maastricht University. I find this collaborative, ethnographic research opportunity exciting as well as congruous with my qualitative skill sets. My passion for the history of medicine, experience in education, interest in how medical knowledge is created and transmitted, and  collaborative spirit would allow me to contribute to exploring the historical and contemporary pedagogical impacts of technology on medical knowledge creation, communication, and practice.

I am currently finishing my dissertation on the e-motional geographies
of everyday life with diabetes. I expect to defend late August of 2017.
I use archival methods as well as digital ethnography. I analyze
archival correspondence and Reddit discourse about embodied experiences
of diabetes related biomedical technologies. My first chapter examines a history of diabetes and emotion around the time of the discovery of insulin at the University of Toronto. My next chapter explores diabetes, embodied technology and the quantified self. My final chapter looks at flows of personal biomedical waste generated through the treatment of diabetes.  
During my PhD, I also collaborated with others on waste research in the genera research group and I conducted ethnographic interviews with waste water treatment facility employees
about needles and other biomedical waste in sewerage. Additionally, I was a research assistant and conducted ethnographic research in online communities about autism and sexuality.
During my MA program, I worked for Dr. Helen Regis, an Anthropologist at
Louisiana State University, on an ethnographic project in New Orleans,
Louisiana. I identified and organized participants, I collected 20 oral
histories in Spanish and English from Latin American Cultural Activists
in post-Katrina New Orleans. I also collected mental maps for the
project, conducted archival research, and prepared a literature review.
Examining the intersections of medical and technological histories with
critical ethnography and critical pedagogies in medicine is an exciting
prospect for me. I have lived and worked abroad as a student,
researcher, and teacher. I am quite keen on collaborating with graduate
students and Dr. Anna Harris' research group. Admittedly, I have not previously worked
with translators, but consider it an interesting opportunity and challenge.
I am interested in the tooling of collaboration, particularly in
choosing technological tools to facilitate reproduction, analysis,
communication, publication, and accessibility.
