  I am currently finishing my dissertation on the e-motional geographies of everyday life with diabetes. I expect to defend late August of 2017. I use archival methods as well as digital ethnography. I am analyzing archival correpsondence and reddit discourse about embodied experiences of diabetes related biomedical technologies. During my PhD, I collaborated with others on waste research in the genera research group. I conducted interviews with waste water treatment facility employees about needles in sewerage. I was also a research assistant and conducted ethnographic research in online communities about autism and sexuality. During my MA program, I worked for Dr. Helen Regis, an Anthropologist at Louisiana State University, on an ethnographic project in New Orleans, Louisiana. I identified and organized participants, I collected oral histories in Spanish and English from Latin American Cultural Activists in post-Katrina New Orleans. I also collected mental maps for the project, conducted archival research, and prepared a literature review. Examining the intersections of medical and technological histories with critical ethnography and critical pedagogies in medicine is an exciting prospect for me. 
  
  I have lived and worked abroad as a student, researcher, and teacher. I am quite keen on collaborating with graduate students and Dr. Anna Harris. Admittedly, I have not previously worked with translators, but find it an interesting opportunity and challenge.
  I am interested in the tooling of collaboration, particularly in choosing technological tools to facilitate reproduction, analysis, communication, publication, and accessibility.
